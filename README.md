# Numerical-Analysis
My homework for YTU Numerical Analysis class.

This project contains code for:

-Non-linear root finding methods
--Basic iteration, Bisection method, Graphical method, Newton-Raphson method, Regula falsi method, Secant method

-Solving Systems of Linear Equation
--LU decomposition, Cramer's rule, Jacobi method, Gauss-Seidel method

-Numerical Integration
--Trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule
---Also it contains recursive implementation of Simpson's method for solving double and triple integrals.
